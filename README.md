# Let's build something.

Currently in my final year of High School I am an aspiring Engineer and Science student. I love all things STEM from programming to chemistry and am always working on my next project. I am the creator and cofounder of [NavCS](https://navcs.pythonanywhere.com) and the creator of [PyGraphica](https://pypi.org/project/PyGraphica).
